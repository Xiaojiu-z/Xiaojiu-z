Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yuxuan Zhang, a masters student from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Sep. 2022 â€“ Expected Mar. 2025).

I have a passion for exploring AIGC, particularly research related to the diffusion model. 

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music (especially Jay Chou's music). I also enjoy playing badminton and skiing.
