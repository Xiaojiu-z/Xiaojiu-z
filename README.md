Hi there 👋 I'm Yuxuan Zhang, a master's student from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

I have a passion for exploring AIGC, particularly research related to the diffusion model. 

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music (especially Jay Chou's music). I also enjoy playing badminton and skiing.

I am very open to discussing scientific research or just having a casual chat with you 😁.
